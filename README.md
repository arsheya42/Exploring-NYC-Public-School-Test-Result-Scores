# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the performance of New York City (NYC) public schools based on SAT scores. The SAT is a standardized test widely used in the United States for college admissions, assessing students' literacy, numeracy, and writing skills across three sections: reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. Understanding school performance is crucial for various stakeholders, including policymakers, educators, researchers, and parents.

## Dataset
The analysis utilizes the schools.csv dataset, which contains information regarding the SAT performance of NYC public schools. Below is a preview of the dataset's key columns:

| Column | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| school_id  | Unique identifier for each school |
| school_name  | Name of the school |
| city  | City where the school is located |
| state  | State where the school is located |
| sat_reading  | Average SAT reading score |
| sat_math  | Average SAT math score |
| total_students  | Total number of students enrolled |

## Objectives

Analyze the SAT performance of NYC public schools across the three sections.
Identify trends and patterns in academic performance among different schools.
Compare scores to provide insights that can inform educational policy, school choice, and resource allocation.

## Getting Started
